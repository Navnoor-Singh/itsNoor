# Navnoor's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my work, skills, and experiences as a web developer and designer. The site is built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion** to create a smooth, responsive, and interactive user experience.

**Features**

- **Responsive Design:** The website is fully responsive, with a smooth transition between desktop and mobile views.
- **Dynamic Background:** The desktop view features a background image, while the mobile view uses a background video. The transition between these views is smooth and visually appealing.
- **Typewriter Effect:** The site title in the navbar features a typewriter effect, giving it a dynamic, professional look.
- **Interactive Navbar:** The navbar is responsive, with a hamburger menu that slides in on mobile devices.
- **Animated Content:** The content on the homepage, including text and buttons, features smooth animations using Framer Motion.
- **Featured Projects:** A section that showcases my top projects with interactive hover effects.
- **About Me:** A brief section that provides information about my background, skills, and interests.
- **Contact Me:** A contact section for potential clients or collaborators to reach out.

**Technologies Used**

- **Next.js:** A powerful React framework for building server-side rendered applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for fast and efficient styling.
