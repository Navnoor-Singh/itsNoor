# Navnoor's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my work, skills, and experiences as a web developer and designer. The site is built using **Next.js**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion**, and **EmailJS** to create a smooth, responsive, and interactive user experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Background**: The desktop view features a background image, while the mobile view uses a background video. The transition between these views is smooth and visually appealing.
- **Animated Content**: The content throughout the site, including text, buttons, and sections, features smooth animations using Framer Motion.
- **Interactive Navbar**: The navbar is responsive, with a hamburger menu that slides in on mobile devices, offering an easy and intuitive navigation experience.
- **Featured Projects**: A section that showcases my top projects with interactive hover effects and background animations.
- **About Me**: A detailed section providing information about my background, skills, and interests, with links to my resume and additional information.
- **Contact Me**: A contact section powered by **EmailJS**, allowing potential clients or collaborators to send inquiries directly to my email.
- **Cyberpunk Gradient Effects**: Several elements, including buttons and cards, use a custom cyberpunk gradient effect that enhances the visual appeal.
- **Islands for Information**: Key information such as certifications, languages, and locations are presented as clickable "islands" with hover effects, leading to external resources like Wikipedia.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A powerful React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for fast and efficient styling.
- **Framer Motion**: A library for creating smooth animations and interactions in React.
- **EmailJS**: A service for sending emails directly from the client-side, used in the contact form to send inquiries.
- **HTML5 & CSS3**: The foundational technologies for building and styling web pages.
